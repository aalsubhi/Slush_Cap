\section{Abstract}
Self-powered systems relay on the harvested energy from their environments where they deployed. The availability of that energy is ranging between scarce and burst time. Large capacitors have been used to power all system components (processors, sensors, actuators, etc) and making use of the excessive energy on its peak for long running time and scarifying the availability of the system where large capacitors take long time to charge.
This paper presents a novel approach to store the excessive energy, Called xx, that uses capacitor that has higher voltage threshold than system components to assure charging when all small capacitors of components got fully charged.  This enables the devices to charge very quickly and store the excessive energy to use it in the energy famine time for less failure and more viability.  We have implemented a XX reference design as peripheral for Flicker platform and run three type of sensing applications(event detection, continues sensing ,and ). Xx improves event detection accuracy by yy and provide zz more sensing period than devices without it.
