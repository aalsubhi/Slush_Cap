all peripherals threshold need to be above mcu threshold. The Flicker mcu turns on at 2.5 volts and shutdown at 1.9
Flicker's voltage reference for UFOP is 125mv and all threshold should be above it.


1-Photocells:anything up to 100V  
charge at 2.6v : R1= 100M  , R2= 5.1M , threshold = 126 mv
fire interrupt at 2.9v : R1= 100M  , R2= 4.64M , threshold = 129 mv
cap = 10uf

2- leaf wetness sensor : (2.5 - 5) V
current requirement at 2.5 V is around 2 mA, and a 5 V it is 7 to 8 mA.
charge at 2.6v : R1= 100M  , R2= 5.1M , threshold = 126 mv
fire interrupt at 2.9v : R1=100 M  , R2= 4.64 M , threshold = 129  mv
cap = 15uf

3- TMP35(temperature sensor): (2.7-5.5)
current = 50 Î¼A
charge at 2.6v : R1= 100M  , R2= 5.1M , threshold = 126 mv
fire interrupt at 2.9v : R1= 100M  , R2= 4.64M , threshold = 129 mv
cap = 10uf


4-Radio: (1.8-3.6)V
to charge at 2.9v : R1= 100M  , R2= 4.64 M , threshold = 129 mv
to fire interrupt at 3.1 :R1=100M , R2=4.22M , threshold = 126 mv
cap = 47uf



temp cap 10uf
